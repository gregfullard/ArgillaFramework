Introduction
------------
A formal process is followed for maintaining the framework. This ensures that the classification scheme is appropriate.


Random Notes
------------
* Many tools are actually suites of tools that fit into multiple categories. To facilitate this, tags are attached to each tool.
* We should have detailed pages for each tool 
* It might be sensible to publish the framework using Sling (Slick, to be precise) instead of Sphinx. That will allow the dynamic functionality while retaining the content-centric nature
* To find new tools in each category we need to run a Google "vs" search for the existing tools that have been identified.
