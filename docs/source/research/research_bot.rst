Research Bot
============

A framework like Argilla is very susceptible to getting out of date and irrelevant. To mitigate this risk, and to assist in compiling the framework 
we use an automated research bot for:
* Tracking the popularity of identified tools using twitter and stackoverflow metrics
* Identifying new tools using automated google notifications on "xxx vs" searches
* Identifying thought leaders on selected topics
* Identfying articles on key topics and adding them to the list of articles in each capbility write-up (Probably including a human workflow)

The framework will probably also:
* Include automated twitter posts on selected topics
* Send infrequent polls to participants to track which tools they prefer in certain categories
