Stakeholder Communication
=========================

Successful software projects rely on regular and productive communication between the team members. 
Email is simply not sufficient. Daily standups help as well as being co-located, but teams also need instant messaging and voice chat capability

We need tools and processes that guide stakeholder communication. 
This consists of bidirectional communication, for example, sending weekly timesheets, but also allowing the stakheholder to provide feedback
