Progress Tracking and Reports
=============================

In order to address problems before they become insurmountable, all projects need a consistent, objective progress tracking system.

This system (or set of tools) should provide weekly progress feedback to all involved stakeholders with a simple method for raising concerns.

This will likely be built as a jira plugin and as a tool that leverages the JIRA API
