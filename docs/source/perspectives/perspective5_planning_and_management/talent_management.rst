Talent Management
=================

A succesful team requires talented team members. We need a repeatable process for finding and hiring the most talented software developers.

This will include online assessment tools, a clearly defined interview process, which includes one telephonic screening and at least 3 in 
person interviews. The interview process should also include a short 4 hour project that the candidate can complete over a weekend.

Each job must have a clearly defined spec with clearly stated expectations which should be communicated with the candidates.

We should also have a proper database of potential candidates. Hiring should be direct, as well as using recruitment agents
