Project Templating
==================

Source code repositories need to be structured in some best practice manner.

Shell scripts in an expected place. Docs in an expected place test scripts in an expected place etc.

Project templating is about providing templates that make the creation of projects simple and easy, and ensuring the projects always
have a consistent structure.
