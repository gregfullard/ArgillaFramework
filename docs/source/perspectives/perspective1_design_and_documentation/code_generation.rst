Code Generation (Model Driven Architecture)
===========================================

Code generation has many aspects. Here we focus on generating code from UML models. Not all code generation makes software better. Often, code generation
makes code less maintainable and therefore more expensive over time. 

Within the Argilla Framework we've found the following types of code generation useful:
* Generating Database DDL scripts from DB design diagrams
* Generating XSD files from XSD schema diagrams
* Generating POJO classes from UML class diagrams (not always useful)
