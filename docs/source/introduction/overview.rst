Overview
========
An important starting point for the framework is ther understanding that software development project have many "aspects",
 and often each aspect has very different goals, stakeholders and approaches. To compile a single framework that will bring together 
 these different "aspects", we have divided them into perspectives. 

The following perspectives have been defined for the framework:

* Design and Documentation
* Development
* Runtime Platform
* Operations
* Planning and Management
* Testing

Within each of these perspectives is a list of capabilities. Each capability defines a single capability that the team must possess in order to 
be a world class software development team. 

Each capability will be separately described in terms of it's goals, how it relates to other capabilities, tools that can be used to achienve
the capability, integration and implementation notes. The framework will also add patterns and anti-patterns for each of the capabilities. 

The identified capabilities are:
