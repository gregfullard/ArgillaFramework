Background

TODO: Add some stats about software project failures

IT professionals are aware of this problem and are constantly working on defining frameworks, methodologies, patterns and approaches to achieve the
holy grail of software development: Consistently building high quality software on time and within budget.

TODO: Give some examples

But if so many people are working on solviong this problem, why isn't it getting solved? 

* Perhaps it is already solved, but the lucky ones who have solved the problem are reaping the benefits and therefore they are not sharing the secret recipe.
* Perhaps it is already solved, but egos are getting in the way of seeing the truth.
* Perhaps it is already solved, but the solution will make IT project seem more expensive and business owners simply don't want to acknowledge the fact.
* Perhaps the various methodologies and patterns don't work, because they were compiled by people who are too out of touch with the realities of software development.
* Perhaps the problem has been solved entirely, but more people just need to start using the solution

Such a discussion will likely end in a long fruitless debate, and not much working software

The Argilla Framework holds the opinion that: 
* Most of the existing approaches, methodologies, etc have something of value to offer
* Existing approaches tend to be restricted to specific "perspectives" of the sofware landscape
* Existing approaches are treated as "islands" and are difficult to use together
* New approaches are entering the market so quickly, that it is almost impossible to know where to focus your attention
* It is impossible to solve the broader problem across all technologies, so one needs to limit the scope of your efforts to a specific ballpark

We have therefore decided to invest dedicated time in understanding the various perspectives and capabilities that are required to consistently
and successfully build large scale software projects that have a large Java component. 
The Argilla Capability Framework represents a work-in-progress definition of processes, tools and techniques, including specific details about how 
they work together.

As a key point, the Framework committers firmly believe that nobody knows everything and we therefor actively seek outr practical knowledge from 
the widest possible set of contributors. However, the framework is not an attempt to "design by committee", it will remaing opinionated to ensure
simplicity. So in short: This is not an attempt at another CMMI, it is an attempt to provide practical, simple advice, techniques and tools that can be 
used from day 1, to build successful software projects.

Why
---
The most important question to be asked about the background of the Argilla Framework is "Why?"

Why would it be worthwhile to spend time and money on bringing together existing knowledge and tools into a single framework?

What is the ultimate goal? In other words: How will we measure the success of the framework?

Here's a humble attempt at an answer:
* The intention of the Argilla framework is to unify and support Java software development professionals in the South African environment, to allow
South African software to stand amongst the best in the world.

Partners
--------
The Argilla framework is a collaboration between many industry role-players. This page will list the partners, which will include groups and
companies, but also individuals.
